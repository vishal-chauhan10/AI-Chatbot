# Context7 Integration Rules

## Automatic Context7 Usage

**CRITICAL**: When the user asks about any of the following topics, ALWAYS use Context7 to get the most current and accurate information:

### Framework & Library Documentation

- When discussing React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or any JavaScript framework
- When asking about Node.js, Express, Fastify, or backend frameworks
- When working with Python frameworks (FastAPI, Django, Flask, Pydantic)
- When using AI/ML libraries (LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI SDK, Anthropic SDK)
- When implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
- When working with vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, FAISS)
- When working with UI libraries (Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, Chakra UI, etc.)
- When dealing with state management (Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc.)
- When using build tools (Vite, Webpack, Turbo, esbuild)

### API & Service Integration

- When integrating with third-party APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, Auth0, Firebase, etc.)
- When working with cloud services (AWS, Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare)
- When setting up authentication systems
- When configuring databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)
- When working with ORMs (Prisma, Mongoose, TypeORM, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
- When implementing document processing and embeddings
- When setting up async/await patterns in Python or JavaScript

### Development Tools & Configuration

- When setting up linting (ESLint, Prettier, Biome)
- When configuring TypeScript, testing frameworks (Jest, Vitest, Playwright)
- When working with package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun)
- When setting up CI/CD pipelines
- When configuring development environments

### Code Examples & Implementation Patterns

- When asking "how to implement", "show me an example", or "what's the best way to"
- When requesting code snippets or boilerplate
- When asking about best practices or current patterns
- When troubleshooting framework-specific issues

## Context7 Usage Instructions

### For the AI Assistant:

1. **Always append "use context7" to queries** when any of the above topics are mentioned
2. **Be specific about versions** when known (e.g., "Next.js 14", "React 18")
3. **Focus on current best practices** rather than outdated approaches
4. **Prioritize official documentation** and established patterns

### Query Enhancement Examples:

- User asks: "How do I create a React component?"
- Enhanced query: "How do I create a React functional component with TypeScript and modern hooks? use context7"

- User asks: "Set up authentication"
- Enhanced query: "How do I implement authentication in Next.js 14 with JWT and middleware? use context7"

## When NOT to Use Context7

- Basic programming concepts (loops, conditionals, data structures)
- Language fundamentals (JavaScript basics, HTML/CSS basics)
- Mathematical calculations or algorithms
- General debugging that doesn't involve specific frameworks
- File system operations or basic terminal commands

## Project-Specific Context

For this ChatBot-AYM project, automatically use Context7 when discussing:

- Chatbot frameworks and libraries (LangChain, LangGraph, Rasa, etc.)
- AI/ML integration patterns (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- RAG implementation (vector stores, embeddings, retrieval strategies)
- FastAPI backend development and async patterns
- Real-time messaging implementations
- Authentication for chat applications
- Database schemas for chat systems
- WebSocket or Server-Sent Events setup
- Modern chat UI patterns and components
- Python async/await patterns and FastAPI best practices
- Document processing and text chunking strategies

## Quality Assurance

When using Context7:

1. **Verify information currency** - Ensure examples use current syntax
2. **Check for deprecation warnings** - Avoid outdated methods
3. **Provide working examples** - Test code snippets when possible
4. **Include error handling** - Show robust implementation patterns
5. **Follow security best practices** - Especially for authentication and data handling

## Performance Considerations

- Use Context7 for complex queries where accuracy is critical
- Balance between getting current info and response speed
- Cache frequently used patterns in project documentation
- Prefer Context7 for rapidly evolving technologies over stable ones

## Coding Best Practices & Safety Rules

**CRITICAL**: Always follow these principles when providing code solutions:

### Code Quality & Safety

1. **Think Thoroughly**: Analyze the full context and implications before suggesting changes
2. **Preserve Functionality**: Never break existing functionalities - always check dependencies
3. **Best Practices**: Follow language-specific best practices and conventions
4. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling and validation
5. **Security First**: Implement secure coding practices, especially for authentication and data handling
6. **Performance Aware**: Consider performance implications of suggested changes

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Incremental Changes**: Suggest small, testable changes rather than large refactors
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing integrations
3. **Documentation**: Include clear comments and docstrings for complex logic
4. **Testing Considerations**: Mention testing strategies for new implementations
5. **Dependency Management**: Be mindful of adding new dependencies

### Python/FastAPI Specific

1. **Async/Await**: Use proper async patterns for I/O operations
2. **Type Hints**: Include comprehensive type hints with Pydantic models
3. **Exception Handling**: Use FastAPI's HTTPException for API errors
4. **Dependency Injection**: Leverage FastAPI's dependency injection system
5. **Data Validation**: Use Pydantic for request/response validation

### AI/ML & RAG Specific

1. **Token Management**: Be mindful of token limits and costs
2. **Embedding Efficiency**: Optimize vector operations and storage
3. **Context Window**: Manage context window limits effectively
4. **Fallback Strategies**: Implement fallbacks for AI service failures
5. **Data Privacy**: Ensure sensitive data handling in RAG pipelines
